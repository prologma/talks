    "The book is aimed at graduate students, including both the general graduate population as well as students intending to specialize in programming language re- search. For the former, it should serve to introduce a number of key ideas from the design and analysis of programming languages, with type systems as an organizing structure. For the latter, it should provide sufficient background to proceed directly on to the research literature. The book is suitable for self-study by researchers in other areas who want to learn something about type systems, and should be a useful reference for experts. The first several chapters should be usable in upper-division undergraduate courses. "

    "Proposed approaches to improving software quality include—among other ideas—a broad spectrum of techniques for helping ensure that a software system behaves correctly with respect to some specifica- tion, implicit or explicit, of its desired behavior. On one end of this spectrum are powerful frameworks such as algebraic specification languages, modal logics, and denotational semantics; these can be used to express very general correctness prop- erties but are cumbersome to use and demand significant involvement by the pro- grammer not only in the application domain but also in the formal subtleties of the framework itself. At the other end are techniques of much more limited power—so limited that they can be built into compilers or linkers and thus “applied” even by programmers unfamiliar with the underlying theories. Such methods often take the form of type systems. "

In the late 1950s and early 1960s (e.g., ALGOL), the classification was extended to structured data (arrays of records, etc.) and higher-order functions. Beginning in the 1970s, these early foundations have been extended in many directions...\n",
